To start in an NLP project involving training a model based on president's speeches, the first step would be retreiving that information. 
This would likely be done by using a web scraping tool. I am not well versed in web scraping but I know that there are many tools out there that would be 
useful for such a thing. The next step would be to clean the data to get it ready to be used in such a model, similar to what was accomplished in parts one 
and two of this assignment. Storing the data is also another worry and that should be done using something typically easy such as a csv file.
