The difference between BPE and WordPiece is how they function. BPE uses a vocabulary that includes all possible base characters and uses bytes. WordPiece
uses a bigram technique where it takes the inputted sentence and first splits it up into single character tokens. I will start with the example of using:

low low low low low lowest lowest newer newer newer newer newer newer wider wider wider new new

The base vocabulary using WordPiece for this would be ("l", "o", "w", "e", "s", "t", "n", "r", "i", "d")

The next step would be to find the frequency of each bigram, meaning that "lo" would be checked, then "ow", then "we", and so on and so forth.

Then the two most frequent bigrams will be merged to create a single token. WordPiece will use this technique to create a tokenized list for the inputted words.
